# 📝 Programming II – PartialExam-POO-2025-02-B

## Context
You are hired to develop a simple system for a university.  
The system must manage students.  
Read the UML diagram and implement it in **Java** using encapsulation and overloaded constructors.

## UML Diagram
👉 [View UML Diagram](https://www.rapidcharts.ai/editor/a371fd68-e5fc-4daf-9a89-e64c5efabca5/View)

## Instructions
1. Implement the `Student` class as in the UML diagram.  
2. All attributes must be **private**.  
3. Use **getters and setters** where necessary.  
4. Implement the **three constructors** (default, with name+age, with name+age+id).  
5. Implement the method `showInfo()`.  
6. In a `Main` class, create at least **two Student objects** using different constructors and test the method `showInfo()`.

👉 *How did you apply your own learning strategies to solve this exam? Mention one difficulty and how you solved it.*

## Evaluation Criteria
- **UML implementation in Java (attributes, constructors, methods):** 50%  
- **Objects created and tested in `Main`:** 20%  
- **Reflection** 30%
